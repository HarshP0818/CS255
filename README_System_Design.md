# System Analysis and Design Portfolio

This repository includes key documentation from two major projects completed during my course in system analysis and design. The documents showcase my ability to gather business requirements, analyze user needs, and design effective technical solutions. These examples demonstrate critical thinking, communication with stakeholders, and the application of system design principles.

## Included Files

**From Project One:**
- Business Requirements Document

**From Project Two:**
- System Design Document

## Reflections

### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project involved designing a system for a client named DriverPass, a company that provides driving instruction services. The client wanted a comprehensive system to manage user registration, scheduling driving lessons and tests, purchasing study materials, and tracking student progress. The goal was to create a digital platform that streamlined the entire user journey—from signup to licensing.

### What did you do particularly well?

I did particularly well in breaking down complex user requirements into clear, actionable business needs and translating them into a structured design. I also created detailed diagrams and documentation that effectively communicated the system architecture to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise one part, it would be the use case descriptions. While they captured the general flow of user actions, I would expand them to include more edge cases and exception handling. This would provide a more comprehensive picture of system behavior under various conditions.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs by analyzing the project requirements, identifying the primary user roles, and considering their goals and pain points. This was implemented through features like easy navigation, automated scheduling, and access to digital learning materials. Considering user needs is crucial because a system that doesn’t align with real-world use will ultimately fail in adoption and satisfaction.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach software design by first understanding the business context and gathering detailed requirements. Then, I use techniques like creating user stories, UML diagrams, and data flow diagrams to visualize the system. In the future, I will continue to use iterative design, stakeholder feedback, and prototyping to ensure the system aligns closely with user needs and is scalable for future growth.
